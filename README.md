Hello people, this is a mini project built by Abdellah Hallou, Walid Damou, and Chaima Izouarhn, in 10 days. this project is a simulation of tuition services that provide online services for students, and as ENSAM CASABLANCA students, we have to create a small demo of the tuition service application of our School. 
## Project requirements:
- You should have the latest version of Python (3.10.1) : https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Create virtual environment (venv): https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
- After creating the venv, from the terminal go to your project directory and type: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Now the project should work perfectly
- To test the project you have to run first the file db.py then insert.py,  but before running the insert.py file make sure you put your personal information inside the insert request to have a nice experience with the app.
- Now you are ready to run app.py and test the project, so first you need the activate your account, to log in, here you need to go right away to lines 707 and 708 and do your modifications to have a nice experience.
